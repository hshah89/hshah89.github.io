## Adding Bluetooth to your next project

In this tutorial, I will be going over how to interface the HC-5 Bluetooth module to an Arduino board.

The HC-05 module is very straightforward and simple to use. It can be configured as a Master or Slave device. It has 6 pins for connections.

This device can be connected as a software serial port for any microprocessor. For this post, I will be use an Arduino nano.

The version I bought from eBay has a pushbutton that has to be pressed during the configuration of the device.

## Parts Used

1. HC-05 Bluetooth module (x2)
2. Arduino Nano (or other versions) (x2)
3. Breadboard
4. Jumper wires

Here are the pinouts and connections to an Arduino nano:

## Pinouts

| HC-05         | Arduino Nano  |
| ------------- |---------------|
| State         | NC            |
| Rx            | 7             |
| Tx            | 8             |
| GND           | GND           |
| Vcc           | +3.3V         |
| En/Key        | NC            |


Usually, the state pin allows the control of the AT mode. AT mode is used to configure the device. For the versions with the button, the state pin doesn't need to be connected.

## Software

The Arduino code needed to talk to the HC-05 module is shown below:


``` cpp
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>

#define bt_tx_pin 7     // connect to hc-05 rx pin
#define bt_rx_pin 8     // connect to hc-05 tx pin
#define bt_en_pin 9     // connect to hc-05 en pin
#define bt_state_pin 10 // connect to hc-05 state pin

SoftwareSerial bt_serial(bt_rx_pin, bt_tx_pin);

void setup()
{
    pinMode(bt_rx_pin, INPUT);
    pinMode(bt_tx_pin, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(bt_en_pin, OUTPUT);
    pinMode(bt_state_pin, OUTPUT);

    Serial.begin(9600);
    bt_serial.begin(38400);
}

void loop()
{

    if (bt_serial.available())
    {
        Serial.write(bt_serial.read());
    }

    if (Serial.available())
    {
        bt_serial.write(Serial.read());
    }
}
```

Only a handful of AT commands are needed to configure the module as either a `Master` or a `Slave`. A link to all the AT commands are linked below:

[Link to all AT commands](https://www.itead.cc/wiki/Serial_Port_Bluetooth_Module_(Master/Slave)_:_HC-05)

In the event you encounter an error when sending an AT command, refer to this link:

## Configuration

After connecting up the module to the Arduino and loading the program, the module should be blinking rapidly.


#### Place in AT Mode
> 1. Remove the GND pin connection
> 2. Press and hold the button near the state pin
> 3. Connect the GND pin back to the Arduino
> 4. It should now to blinking every second
> 5. Open up the terminal


Once you're in the terminal, type ```AT``` and it should reponse back with ```OK```. 

> Make sure that each command has a termination of `\r\n`

<div class="divider"></div>

#### Get device address

One device will be the master and the other will be the slave device. Use the `AT+ADDR?` command to find the address of each module

``` txt
1st Device: Master

>>> AT+ADDR?
+ADDR:14:1:141194
OK

2nd Device: Slave

>>> AT+ADDR?
+ADDR:98D3:41:F5CC0B
OK
```

<div class="divider"></div>

#### Configure Slave Device

Hold on to the button while sending these commands

``` txt
>>> AT+ORGL
OK
>>> AT+UART=38400,0,0
OK
>>> AT+RMAAD
OK
>>> AT+ROLE=0
OK
>>> AT+CMODE=0
OK
```

At the very end, type in `AT+RESET` this will initialize the device. At this point, the device should be blinking rapidly

Next we configure the Master device

<div class="divider"></div>

#### Configure Master Device

Hold on to the button while sending these commands

``` txt
>>> AT+ORGL
OK
>>> AT+UART=38400,0,0
OK
>>> AT+RMAAD
OK
>>> AT+ROLE=1
OK
>>> AT+CMODE=0
OK
>>> AT+BIND="98D3,41,F5CC0B"
OK
```
At the very end, type in `AT+RESET` this will initialize the device. After a few seconds, the two devices should pair up. This will be indicated by unison repeated blinking every 1 second.

That should be it. Now you have Arduino devices that can communicate with each other over Bluetooth. On the next post, I will be showing how to build chat window using two Arduinos over Bluetooth. Stay tuned!
