## Adding Bluetooth to your next project

In this tutorial, I will be going over how to interface the HC-5 Bluetooth module to an Arduino board.

The HC-05 module is very straightforward and simple to use. It can be configured as a Master or Slave device. It has 6 pins for connections.

This device creates a software UART for any version of an arduino board.

The version I bought from eBay has a pushbutton that has to be pressed during the configuration of the device.

## Parts Used

1. HC-05 Bluetooth module
2. Arduino Nano (or other versions
3. Breadboard
4. Jumper wires

Here are the pinouts and connections to an Arduino nano:

## Pinouts

| HC-05         | Arduino Nano  |
| ------------- |---------------|
| State         | NC            |
| Rx            | 7             |
| Tx            | 8             |
| GND           | GND           |
| Vcc           | +3.3V         |
| En/Key        | NC            |

Usually, the state pin allows the control of the AT mode. AT mode is used to configure the device. For the versions with the button, the state pin doesn't need to be connected.
