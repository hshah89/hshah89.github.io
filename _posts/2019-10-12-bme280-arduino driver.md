## Temperature, Humidity, and Pressure Sensor

The BME280 is a combined digital temperature, humidity, and pressure sensor. It comes in a small 2.5 mm x 2.5 mm package. A breakout board with the necessary pullup resistors and voltage translator ICs can be purchsed online at various places. I bought mine from Aliexpress.
